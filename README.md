## Sprox
#### Sprox is a simple game written in React JS as a way for me to learn React better.
It is a game of memorization and knowledge. You click any two cards and try to match them. If you get it right, those two cards come off the board. If you get it wrong, then those cards turn back over and you have to try again. To win the game, you must clear the board of all cards. The lower the number of cards you have to flip, the better your score is (lowest score wins). There are three different game types: bands, books, and planets. For bands, you try to match the musician with the band they are in. For books, you match the book with the author. And for planets, you match the planet with the distance from the sun.

#### Scripts:
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
