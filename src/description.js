        This is a game of memorization and knowledge. You click any two cards and try to match the Planet with its distance from the Sun (in millions of miles).
        If you get it right, those two cards come off the board. If you get it wrong, then those cards turn back over and you have to try again.
        To win the game, you must clear the board of all cards. The lower the number of cards you have to flip, the better your score is (lowest score wins).
