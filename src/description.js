        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a game of memorization and knowledge. You click any two cards and try to match them. If you get it right, those two cards come off the board. If you get it wrong, then those cards turn back over and you have to try again.
        To win the game, you must clear the board of all cards. The lower the number of cards you have to flip, the better your score is (lowest score wins).
        There are three different game types: bands, books, and planets. For bands, you try to match the musician with the band they are in. 
        For books, you match the book with the author. And for planets, you match the planet with the distance from the sun.
